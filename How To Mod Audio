1) DOWNLOAD TOOLS
Download this rar file and extract FSB Ext: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529900741998149643/659024367648505871/sound_editing_resources.rar
Download DSSI (Dark Souls Sound Inserter): https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1193
Download UXM: https://www.nexusmods.com/sekiro/mods/26?tab=description

2) ACCESS SOUND FILES
First, open UXM and link it to your "sekiro.exe". Then press "Unpack".
Once that's done, go to your "sound" folder in your Sekiro main directory (e.g. E:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Sekiro).
You should see a long list of files. Files that end in ".fsb" are the only ones that you want.

3) COPY DESIRED SOUND FILES
You can identify which fsbs you want by looking at their name.
main.fsb and smain.fsb contain most generic sound effects, such as deflecting, death, pain, and healing.
c#.fsb is the sound file for a character with the matching ID (See here for details: https://github.com/SekiroResurrection/modding-wiki/wiki/Characters).
vm#.fsb contains most, but not all, dialogue on map number #.
sm#.fsb contains music for map number #.

3a) MAP IDs
10: Hirata Estate 
11: Ashina Outskirts/Castle/Reservoir 
13: Abandonded Dungeon
15: Ashina Depths/Mibu Village
17: Sunken Valley
20: Senpou Temple
25: Fountainhead Palace

4) OPEN FILES
Using the DSSI, open the fsb you want to edit. 
Using the Add Sample button, add any sound effects you want to use. They must be either mp3 or WAV.
You can use the play button in the FSB Explorer tab to figure out which sound is which.
Select a sample, hit set target, then select the sound you want (NOTE: You can use the ID of the sound on the far right to help you find it.)

If the DSSI doesn't let you open the fsb, saying that it isn't actually an fsb, then you must do the following:
- Drag the fsb you want to edit into FSBExt.bat in your "Sound Editting Resources" which you downloaded from the link right at the start.
- The file should be "filename_crypt.fsb"
- You can now use this file as normal
- Once your finished editting the file, drag it into the exe again so its called "filename_crypt_crypt.fsb".
- Get rid of the "crypt"s in the file name and it should work.
